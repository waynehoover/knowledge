# Meta

I use gitbook.com to generate the website, and github to store these notes in markdown format.

To make changes I usually edit or create a file on my machine and then sync it to github.

To quickly search my files I have created a simple alfred workflow that searches all content \(even inside the files\) in knowledge folder.

From alfred I can quickly open a file to edit or get information from. I am using alfred-grep as explained [here](https://medium.com/@Gr3g0ire/searching-and-viewing-your-notes-efficiently-with-alfred-32f716db5ae2) to quckly search inside all my notes inside alfred.
