# Meta

I use gitbook.com to generate the website, and github to store these notes in markdown format.

To make changes I usually edit or create a file on my machine and then sync it to github.

To quickly search my files I have created a simple alfred workflow that searches all content \(even inside the files\) in knowledge folder.

From alfred I can quickly open a file to edit or get information from.
