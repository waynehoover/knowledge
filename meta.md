# Meta

I use [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org) to serve the markdown notes as a website. It is hosted on github pages.

To make changes I edit the file locally on my computer and then push it to github. I might also make changes directly on github if I feel the need. Also feel free to open an issue or PR even on any of the files.

To quickly search my files I have created a simple alfred workflow that searches all content even inside the files, in my knowledge folder.

From alfred I can quickly open a file to edit or get information from. I am using alfred-grep as explained [here](https://medium.com/@Gr3g0ire/searching-and-viewing-your-notes-efficiently-with-alfred-32f716db5ae2) to quickly search inside all my notes inside alfred.
