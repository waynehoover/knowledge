# Now! ü§∏‚Äç

I'm currently in Hawaii working remotely as a senior software engineer for [LegitScript](https://legitscript.com) and working on [GlowHealthSummit.com](Glow Health Summit) with friends.

I write a technical blog [here](https://medium.com/@waynehoover) and a more philosophical blog [there](https://blissofbeing.com). I enjoy [taking pictures](https://500px.com/wayneh), [acroyoga](http://www.hooping.org/2013/12/acro-hooping-ashlyn-baum-wayne-hoover), [slacklining](https://www.instagram.com/p/BV5eVy-Fmmk), [juggling](https://www.instagram.com/p/BL9O2siB8KH) and traveling.

You can find me on [FB](https://fb.me/waynehoover) or [IG](https://instagram.com/blissofbeing) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/blissofbeing)
