# Languages and Frameworks

Languages I know fairly well
* Ruby
  * I type on this nearly everyday for work. And Rails is so easy to me now. It's still what I reach for first when putting together a new project. The speed at which I can get something going with ruby and rails is, well fast.
* JS
  * JS is like English, the language franca of the web, which is there I do 90% of my programing for in some way or another.

Frameworks I know well
* Ruby on Rails

Languages I know moderately well
* Elixir
  * Functional languages make me think about programming differently, may I say, better. I like to organize my code more as a data manipulation than as objects, it just makes more sense to me.

Languages I'm interested in learning (in order)
* Crystal
  * The ability to package up a single binary is nice, it's like go but better for me because I know ruby. Static typed, compiled, fast.
* Rust
  * To broaden my horizons to think more about memory management.
* Nim
  * For most of the same reasons as crystal but with a couple interesting language features like its generics and method overloading. It's kind of like crystal is to ruby as nim is to python.

Frameworks I'm interested in learning
* Amber - Crystal
  * Because of its pure speed.
* Svetle3
  * Likes like a nice fresh take on frontend frameworks, I like the idea of the _framework_ being more like a compiler. We usually have a build step in the front end anyways.
* Phoenix
  * Its fault tolerant nature would make me happy to deploy code that is meant to stay up for a long time, or code that need to run many concurrent connections at once.
* VueJS
  * This is like my goto instead of jQuery these days possibly. It's such a nice framework.

Frameworks I have used
* Angular 1 and 2
* VueJS
* Rails 3,4,5
