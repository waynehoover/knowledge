## Note Taking Apps

### What I'm currently using
- [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer)- my favorite for focused writting, I copy this to another app usually
- [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) - I journal with this everyday by using its template features
- [RoamResearch](https://roamresearch.com) - I use this nearly everyday for taking notes and research, it helps me remember old notes I took and helps me draw links between things I'm working on. Amazing tool.

### Other apps I have tried
- The Archive - my favorite of this type of app, but I don't use it.
- Notational Velocity
- FSNotes
- Notable
- nvALT
- Evernote - I use this for saving things to reference later
- Standard Notes
- Joplin
- SimpleNote
- Bear - Beautiful app, but no android support
- https://workflowy.com - I used this a lot until I switched to RoamResearch
- https://dynalist.io - I like htis as it has more features than workflowy, but Roams tools seem the best now.
- https://notion.so - A bit complicated for me
